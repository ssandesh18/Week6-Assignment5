        "GET request is a type of HTTP request method used to request data from a specified resource. GET requests are commonly used to retrieve information from a server. They are designed for querying, searching, or fetching information without modifying any resources on the server. GET method example:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The Request, in Flask, is an object that contains all the data sent from the Client to Server. This data can be recovered using the GET/POST Methods. POST is used when your application expects user input to be received by command or an HTTP request, while GET gets all the information before it even has a chance for submission. Using both methods at once gives perfect freedom but still requires complex UI patterns like AJAX calls etc, with most common applications being frameworks where multiple forms are necessary such as Slack Webhooks, MailgunMailserver, and eCommerce Commerce Framework. With Flask-Request class instead, we don’t have any need anymore since this API allows us flexible handling of many other situations\n"

Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will display in the user's browser.\n",

        "Flask’s render_template is a function that's part of the Flask web framework, and it is responsible for rendering HTML templates. In a detailed and pedantic way, render_template can be described as a function that takes one or more input arguments, including the template file's name, and any number of keyword arguments representing the variables to be passed to the template. The function then processes the template file, replacing placeholders (enclosed in double curly braces {{ ... }}) with their corresponding values, and returns the resulting HTML content as a string."
